# Repo
Pull the repo from this location: https://github.com/jarrettalexander77/OMSCS-7641-Assignment3.

This will contain all experiments and datasets.

# Setup

I used anaconda to setup my environment for this project. As a prereq for this, all of the following packages will need setup.

- Jupyter Notebook
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Scikit Learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- mlrose_hiive

# Data
The wine dataset can be found in the data/ folder.

# Running the Code
All development was completed in a jupyter notebook. There are 3 notebooks - Wine.ipynb, Defaults.ipynb, and Wine_NN.ipynb.

These were modified heavily as testing went on. The final state should represent fairly closely the outputs in the paper.

These notebooks will generate all charts used in the report as well. They will be saved to your computer as you run them. If you want to generate all charts, you will have to update the size value.

# Notes
Some tests exist in the notebook but they do not exist in the final paper. This was probably the hardest one to fit in the page limit so far so lots of stuff was cut to make the limit.
